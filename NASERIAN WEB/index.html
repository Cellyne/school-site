        A library is a collection of books, periodicals, manuscripts, and other materials organized for use and study by the public or a specific group of people. Libraries are established to provide access to information, support lifelong learning, and promote literacy.

        Libraries are often divided into different sections or departments, such as fiction, non-fiction, children's literature, reference materials, periodicals, and audiovisual materials. 
        Many libraries also offer services such as computer and internet access, 
        educational and cultural programming, and assistance with research and information retrieval
